question 1
- read / write file
- quick sort
- binary_searchx





task 2.1
READ QUESTION !!!!!!!!
- pls read question and read and enter csv file into db





task 3.2
- read question carefully, question did not ask to read file, so just copy paste
- be careful when using isinstance() because isinstance also return TRUE for superclass
and its class

i.e. 
>>> a  = Food()
>>> b = DatedFood()
>>>  isinstance(a, Food)
True
>>> isinstance(a, DatedFood)
False
>>> isinstance(b, DatedFood)
True
>>> isinstance(b, Food)
True
