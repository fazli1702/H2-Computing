Terminology (for ease of explanation):
- Visual Hierarchy 
(arrangement or presentation of elements in a way that implies 
importance/time/sequence. <h1> sized heading vs <h4> sized heading. 
Place at top vs place at bottom.) (Is it easy to look for something/guess 
where it is in your app?)

- Mental Model 	
(how the user interface will work, given the similarity to the real world) 
(e.g. You can guess that a volume slider in an app can be clicked and dragged, 
because you do that to the volume slider for a sound system in real life.)

- Affordances 
(the radio button suggests the affordance of a 1 item selection, 
and is not appropriate for a to-do list where you tick multiple tasks as done.)

- Design Patterns 
(The back button of Apple applications is always found at the same place/
Your website navigation tabs are found at the same place.) 


Good UI design

- easily digestable

make use of:
- visual hierarchy

2) Minimse error
e.g affordance of components (form/web app) --> allow/disallow actions

3) Efficiency / Reduce step
